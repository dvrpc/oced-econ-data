# Data

The scripts here fetch data from various locations and, by default, insert it into a database. You can alternatively create CSV files by using the `--csv` flag, e.g. `python3 unemployment.py --csv`. Be sure to create, activate, and set up a virtual environment first, which you can do with:

```
$ python3 -m venv ve
$ . ve/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
